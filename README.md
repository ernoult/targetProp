## Testing Difference Target Propagation (DTP) on MNIST

The goal of this repo is to provide the code to test [Difference Target Propagation (DTP)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7525.pdf) on MNIST, on fully connected architectures
with an arbitrary topology. 

## Package requirements

Run the following command lines to set the environment using conda:
```
conda create --name EP python=3.6
conda activate EP
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
